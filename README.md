# Introduction to Simplified Resonate-and-Fire Neurons

Addendum to the **"Resonate-and-Fire Neurons for Edge-Enhanced EEG Analysis"** poster for the VLDB 2025 conference PhD workshop.

This repository contains two tutorial notebooks on the Simplified Resonate-and-Fire (SRF) neuron model:

1. [The Simplified Resonate-and-Fire Neuron: Part I](tutorial_rf_neuron_1.ipynb)
   - Learn the fundamentals of the Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neuron model.
   - Explore the resonating dynamics (in comparison to the traditional LIF model).
2. [The Simplified Resonate-and-Fire Neuron: Part II](tutorial_rf_neuron_2.ipynb)
   - Simplify the mathematical formulation of the RF neuron model to be more practical and accessible.

These tutorials assume a basic understanding of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and their dynamics.
For an introduction to SNNs, we recommend reading [*"Training Spiking Neural Networks Using Lessons from Deep Learning"* (2023)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242251), and the [accompanying tutorial series](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html).
